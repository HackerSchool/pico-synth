# Hardware Tester
The idea of the hardware tester was to develop a super simple firmware prototype that could be used to test all the functionalities of the synth, as soon as a PCB is assembled.
 
To use the hardware tester:
1. Turn on the Pico in BOOTSEL mode (connect to computer while pressing the "boot" button)
2. Copy the following files to the Pico drive:

- [main.py](main.py)
- [ssd1306.py](ssd1306.py)
- [micropython environment](RPI_PICO-20250415-v1.25.0.uf2)
